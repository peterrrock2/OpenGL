Time so far: ~55 Hours.

Project Notes:
  The leaves on the trees have been turned off to keep the polygon count down. To
  see the leaves, uncomment line 99 in the tree.c file.

  The trees that I made for this scene took a long time to get right. I have also
  been trying to make good water effects for this project, but I have already sunk
  around 20 hours into that, and I don't think that I will be able to finish
  it in time. I have also spent a considerable amount of time redoing some of the
  geometry that I already made since I did not like the way the old things that I
  made were being lit.

  My goals for the rest of the project are to try and put some fog into my scene and
  to make the geometry a little more varied and interesting. I will also try and put
  some shadows into the scene if I can manage to get that to render considering how
  high the polygon count already is. I expect all of this to take me around another
  20 hours or so, which should be doable with the time that we have remaining.

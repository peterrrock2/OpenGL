Time to complete assignment: 12 Hours. I tried to see if I could light a non-orientable surface
   but that turned out to be more difficult than I was expecting, so I just have this.

Code Resources:
  A lot of the code for this assignment was taken or modified from the code for ex13
  shown in class. This is noted in the descriptions given before functions. The rest
  was modified from my submission of last week's assignment.
